# FaceoffFantasy
A web-based hockey pool application. Built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm working on this ambitious product because I love hockey.
I first created the website on Friday, October 13th, 2024, and plan to have a working product available for the start of next season, or even the 2023-2024 playoffs.
Once again, if you're reading this, the product is not finished and this is only a side project I'm working on in my spare time.
